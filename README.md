# Latest update:
- Optimized page readability and accessibility on mobile
- Fixed text overflowing the viewport on certain wiki pages
- ```Code blocks now wrap instead of showing a disgusting looking scrollbar```

This is completely out of date btw, please fork the [original](https://github.com/FIREYAUTO/DistrictCascade) if you want anything.

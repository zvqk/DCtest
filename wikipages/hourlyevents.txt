An hourly event will happen every 1 hour. Every hourly event in-game will give rewards to players participating in them.

## List of Hourly Events
^ Race
| The Race event will teleport all players to a random location in a set of given locations, and will have all players race against each other. It's like a {{timetrials:time-trial}} but it includes all players.
| Rewards:
```
1st Place: Mythical Skin Crate
2nd Place: Legendary Skin Crate
3rd Place: Epic Skin Crate
```
Every player will also get {crl} for participating in the race:
```
MinCurrency = 10
MaxCurrency = 100
Currency = floor(lerp(MinCurrency,MaxCurrency,1-(Place-1)/Players))
```

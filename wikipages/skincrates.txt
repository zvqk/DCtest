Skin Crates are used to get gear skins. Every non-basic skin crate will have different chance rarities.

## Skin Crate Refining
You can refine specific skin crates to recieve a skin crate of a higher tier. You will need `5` lower tier skin crates in order to turn them into the next tier. All exclusive skin crates are not able to be refined.
